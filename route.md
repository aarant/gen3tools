# Glitzer Popping
1. Order party as KOed pokemon, Marshtomp, Abra.
2. Save your game in grass.
3. Enter a wild battle, switch to Abra and flee.
4. Deposit Abra in Box 2 Slot 24.
5. Use Pomeg Berry on Marshtomp.
6. Enter a battle, open the party menu, view Marshtomp's summary, exit, and press up 3 times to corrupt Abra.
7. Flee, you will white out and return to the teleport point.
8. Open the PC and check Box 2.
   - If nothing visibly changed, repeat from 6.
   - If Abra's sprite became an egg, hover over it but do not view its summary.
   - If Abra became a Bad Egg, soft reset and repeat from 3.
   - if Abra became an egg, **and its markings are not distorted**, view its summary and check the Pokeball it's in.
   - If it's in a Luxury or Premier Ball, soft reset and repeat from 3.
   - If it's in a Nest Ball, congrats, you got it!
   - If the markings are distorted, viewing the summary will crash your game, so either YOLO it or repeat from 3.
   - Chance to corrupt is 1/32.
