# Gen3Tools

Tools for TASing and data analysis of Gen 3 Pokemon games.

This is a general repo for all of my Pokemon glitch research docs.

Most of it is disorganized, but there is a GUI gen 3 editor and RNG tool:

Other potentially useful files:

* [Python data structures for Gen 3 Pokemon](pokemon.py)
* ACE codes for [Japanese](jpn.md) and [English](us.md) Emerald
* [Various](emerald-jp.lua) [TAS](emerald-us.lua) [scripts](button_input.lua)
* Unfinished [Japanese Ruby](ruby-jp.md) research
